# EduSketch AI 🎨

Simplifying Complex Concepts with Illustrated Panels

## About the Project

Explaining complex concepts like Photosynthesis, Docker, or Machine Learning can overwhelm learners with walls of text and confusing diagrams.

EduSketch AI solves this by generating 5 simple, illustrated panels that break down any topic step by step. Built with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, it creates engaging visuals with consistent style, speech bubbles, and contextual accuracy.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon submission to showcase how Gemini’s advanced multimodal capabilities can transform education and visual learning.

# Features ✨

📚 Concept to Panels → Turn any topic into 5 easy-to-follow illustrated panels.

🎨 Consistent Freehand Art Style → Panels look uniform across the entire set.

💬 Speech Bubbles & Text Integration → Explanations appear directly in visuals.

🌈 Custom Background Patterns & Palettes → Visually appealing yet clear.

⚡ Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash → Uses style consistency, editing, and text-to-image generation.
